## Overview

Virtual LEDs allow you to "attach" LEDs from multiple ESPs to a main, controlling ESP. These LEDs can be added to an ESP just like physical pins.

On the controlling ESP, go to Config, LED Preferences. 

Select DDP RGB (Network) or Art-Net RGB (Network) as the LED type and enter the Length (number of LEDs on that remote ESP), then enter the ESPs IP address.

Multiple remote ESPs can be setup this way.

For DDP the controlling ESP must be running at least 0.13 firmware while the remotes can be older. As usual, best perfomance is obtained by using an ESP32 for the controlling device. You can use an ESP8266, but only with a small number of LEDs (<300).

Art-Net is only implemented in MoonModules 0.14.0.b1.18.

If your board supports Ethernet, use it instead of WiFi for the most stable performance. 

### DDP 

Bascially the same info as AArt-Net. The Art-Net section contains details on where DDP differs. 

Generally speaking, DDP is the better protocol to use, if everything supports it. 

If you can't use DDP, Art-Net has a much wider adoption.

### Art-Net
ðŸŒœ

Art-Net universe output starts at zero. This is not currently configurable in WLED. Zero is the commonly expected starting universe for Art-Net. Channel output starts at one and is not currently configurable in WLED. One is the expected first channel in Art-Net.

For RGB LEDs, a full universe (170 RGB pixels) produces 510 channels  - channels 511 and 512 will not be transmitted. This is common practice in Art-Net transmit and most (all?) implementations will expect this.

Art-Net output follows xLights' implementation of packet sequence numbering and universe-channel alignment, and transmits in RGB order. The first pixel output data will always be 0:1:R, 0:2:G, 0:3:B for universe:channel:colorpart.

This Art-Net implementation does ignore the "always specify length of data as an even number" part of the official specifications. If you encounter this issue, please file a bug report. Even Art-Net themselves say that this has been widely ignored and receivers should not expect an even value in the data length part of the packet.

### Background
By Troy

First there was DMX (DMX512). It was great for controlling lighting fixtures - "set light to red" sort of thing. "Pan head to the left". "Dim the lights."

Then someone decided that DMX should work over the network rather than RS485 networks (usually over an XLR cable).

So Art-Net and E1.31 were born. DDP is essentially the same thing but slightly better and newer.

All of these are the same premise as DMX512 - send packets of 8-bit numbers (up to 512 8-bit numbers, or 1440 variable bit numbers for DDP) to remote systems.

THEN a bunch of idiots (us) got into the game with massive LED panels.

To send LED data over the network, we still use a network form of DMX. E1.31, Art-Net, and DDP are all "network DMX".

You think of an LED strip (or matrix) as a LOT of dimmable lights:

You have a red dimmable light. 
You have a green dimmable light. 
You have a blue dimmable light.

That's channels 1,2, and 3 - and they makes up one RGB LED.

A DMX universe is 512 channels. You can fit 170 LEDs into 510 channels (170 LEDs each having 3 channels - R, G, and B) 

...and then you skip to the next universe and start at channel 1 again.

#### Using Art-Net/DMX/E1.31 to contol the WLED interface

This is with WLED set to "Effect" in: Settings > Sync Interfaces > Network DMX Input > DMX Mode > "Effect"

Using this table: 

| Channel | Property |
| --- | --- |
1 | Master Dimmer
2 | Effect mode ID
3 | Effect speed
4 | Effect intensity
5 | Effect palette ID
6 | Effect option
7 | Red Primary
8 | Green Primary
9 | Blue Primary
10 | Red Secondary
11 | Green Secondary
12 | Blue Secondary
13 | Red Tertiary
14 | Green Tertiary
15 | Blue Tertiary

So when using Art-Net "Effect" mode in WLED, those 15 sliders in <a href="https://www.qlcplus.org/">QLC+</a> send control data to the 15 parameters in the table.

* Slider 1 is master brightness.
* Slider 2 is effect.
* 9,10,11 are R,G,B primary color.
* etc.

#### Using Art-Net/DMX/E1.31 to contol individual LEDs

This is with WLED set to "Multi RGB" in: Settings > Sync Interfaces > Network DMX Input > DMX Mode > "Multi RGB"

Could you use <a href="https://www.qlcplus.org/">QLC+</a> to send data to a matrix or strip? Absolutely! (But you shouldn't. Normally you will use something like <a href="https://xlights.org/">xLights</a> or <a href="http://www.live-leds.de/">Jinx</a> that "know" how to talk to massive amounts of LEDs over the network.)

The catch is that you need THREE sliders (R/G/B) for every LED.

1,2,3 = pixel 1. (set to red)
4,5,6 = pixel 2. (set to green)
7,8,9 = pixel 3. (set to blue)
10,11,12 = pixel 4. (set to white, all sliders up)

With a panel of 768 pixels, you only need... 2304 sliders to set them all. ðŸ˜„ 

All of the "DMX mode" settings tell WLED how to interperate the incoming DMX data (through whatever Network DMX protocol you're using)

"Multi RGB" is for lighting lots of pixels.
"Effect" is for controlling the WLED instance itself. 
...and the others have their own special methods, some combine both "Effect" and "Multi RGB" functionality. 

WLED -> WLED works fine, of course. Mostly tested with the receiving WLED set to "Multi RGB". There's better ways to sync control between WLED (like... the "Sync" button)

<a href="https://xlights.org/">xLights</a> -> WLED works fine with any protocol they both speak, and WLED set to "Multi RGB"

<a href="http://www.live-leds.de/">Jinx</a> -> WLED works fine with any protocol they both speak, and WLED set to "Multi RGB". Jinx has the absolute worst mapping setup, but some of the coolest effects. 

WLED -> <a href="http://www.live-leds.de/">Jinx</a> technically works, but Jinx only takes a few settings over "network DMX" to remote control the GUI. This will require some tinkering and perhaps building a custom WLED for yourself.

### TODO

I've proposed "DMX into WLED via a physical DMX wire (RS485)." This would be equivalent to "Effect" (and will likely be based on that mapping) so that you could plug WLED boards into a DMX512 cable and have it "do a thing" when you push a slider on the lighting control board/software. **This feature does not currently exist, but is being worked on.**
