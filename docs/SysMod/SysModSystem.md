## System

* Name: name of this instance, default StarBase.
    * [2024040511](https://github.com/ewowi/StarBase/commit/4f12da235bcee958b74f6d932b20a5ffcf9c449c): The name will be stripped from non standard characters so it can be used for Wifi / AP HostName and MDNS name. If name is changed, MDNS will be restarted with the new name, see [UserModMDNS](/StarDocs/UserMod/UserModMDNS)
* Reboot: restart this instance.
* Build: show which build have been installed
* OTA Update: select a bin file and it will directly upload to the board. Firmware bins generated by vscode/pio are now copied to the <user>/Downloads folder so you don't have to search through github subfolders anymore to find the bin. Red or green ball will show failure or success. Update will be effective after reboot !!

## Curl update / upload

Alternetively to OTA Update in the UI, New versions of StarBase can be flashed to an already flashed esp32 using:

```
curl -s -F "update=@<path/firmware.bin>" <ip>/update
```

* replace ```<path/firmware.bin>``` and ```<ip>``` with the relevant values.
* above command will report if the update was succesful
* After sucessful update you need to reboot the device to make the update effective
