## StarBoard

Here are some ideas for the perfect board for StarMod. 
Most likely there are more perfect boards, so they can be added here.

## StarBoardLeds

Mockup:


* USB Powered (2.5A)
* Headers to plugin INMP443 (no onboard mic as we got non functioning mics at  JLCPCB once probably due to wrong hole alignment or too much paste)
* Level shifters with solder pads to enable them per output
* 5 led outputs with standard leds pin (Red, Green, White = +,data,- per default)
* all on one board
* perfect for: plug and play development boards, fairy lights (HSC), 256-400 leds per pin at reduced brightness, 50-125 leds at full brightness

## StarBoard More

* Higher power (1024 leds, 20-50mA each => 20-50A)
* Line in
* Ethernet
* Display (touch?)
